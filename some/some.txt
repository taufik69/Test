This text for this practice of github . git is more smarter than me .

git main task is:

    * connect a local respository to remote repository .

     --> git remote add origin <https url>
        -->|Then check the remote repository is sucessfully connect to the local repository .
          -->| git remote -v 

    * Doing work in working derectory .

        -->| add file to straging.
            -->| use can use this git command .
               -->| git add . or git add file name .


    * After addiing repository staging then you can see what kind of difference between after and before file helps of this git command.

        -->| git diff  thats means difference between file . moral of the stroy you see the all changes.


    * if you want roll back to working directory.

      -->| git reset or git rm --cached [file name]



    * Now the main part of git . this is commit part.

      -->| adding done then you are ready to commmit this file . commit is the identification of repository .
         -->| git commit -m ["Here is the message of about commiting file "]
            -->| git add [file name ] && git commmit -m ["message"]
                -->| git log show the comminting form .
                    -->| git log --oneline show the head of commiting.
                        -->| git checkout [commit head id].
                            -->| git checkout master # back to the previous from i mean reacent commiting portion.
                            -->| git show  # this command show the which file is changes.


    * Now you done commit if you want to rool back to commit .

        --> |git reset --soft HEAD^ 
            # This commmand helps to rollback recent commit . this soft reset don't break to adding or straging.
            -->| git reset HEAD^
                 # This command reset everything i meant its break the commit and through unstage platfom . when you use to this command 
                   then again doing to add or staging file.
                   -->|git reset --hard HEAD^ 
                        # this command break the commit and also its move to file working derectory.
                        -->| git reset --soft HEAD~2
                             # Braking the two commits
                             -->| git reset --soft HEAD~3

    * Here is the push git comomand.

        -->| git push -u origin master/main 
             # Here is the some objection last word is brach name and previous word means the connection keyword it is not default . you can 
               Change here.
               -->| git push . 
                    # if you push in second time just write about command . 


    * Pull commmand.

        -->| git pull [remote repository https link]
